Node & Express Drag-n-Drop Photo Gallery

A simple photo gallery app that lets you drap and drop images into your image folder without all of the fuss of creating numbered file names, just drap and drop. 
I used the excellent lightGallery plugin for the lightbox effect but it's not needed for the drag drop feature.

I used JavaScript for the handler function that renders images randomly from a images array.

`git clone https://github.com/jim3/Node-Express-Photo-Gallery.git`
