Node & Express Drag-n-Drop Photo Gallery

A simple photo gallery app that lets you drap and drop images into an image folder without all of the fuss of creating numbered file names 
I used the excellent [lightGallery](https://www.lightgalleryjs.com/) â™¥ plugin for the lightbox effect, it's not needed for the drag-n-drop "feature",
the rendering of random images on refresh or even the sizing of the images (just uncomment the box div) but it's *super nice* to have.

I used JavaScript for the handler function that renders images randomly from a images array.

`git clone https://github.com/jim3/Node-Express-Photo-Gallery.git`

`npm install`
