### Node & Express Drag-n-Drop Photo Gallery
--- ---------------------------------------
Photo gallery app that lets you drag and drop images into a folder and have them automatically appear in the gallery.

#### Features

- Drag and drop images into the image folder and have them automatically appear in the gallery (no refresh needed) 

- Randomly render images on refresh

- Lightbox effect when clicking on an image

<sub>I used the [lightGallery](https://www.lightgalleryjs.com/) plugin for the lightbox effect</sub>
